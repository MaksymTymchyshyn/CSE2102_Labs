# Implementation Summary - Lab 5: Flask Pub-Sub Server

## What I Implemented

I created a complete HTTP-based publish-subscribe system using Python Flask that meets all the specified requirements.

### Core Components

1. **Flask Web Server** (`app.py`)
   - Implemented all required endpoints using Flask framework
   - Used in-memory dictionary to store subscribers
   - Added comprehensive error handling and HTTP status codes
   - Included logging for debugging and monitoring

2. **Subscriber Management**
   - `POST /subscribers`: Adds new subscribers with name and URL validation
   - `DELETE /subscribers/<name>`: Removes subscribers by name
   - `GET /subscribers`: Returns all subscribers in JSON format
   - Prevents duplicate subscriber names

3. **Publishing System**
   - `POST /publish`: Accepts subject and notifies all subscribers
   - Prints notification messages to console as specified
   - Returns count of subscribers notified
   - `GET /subject`: Retrieves current published subject

4. **Additional Features**
   - Health check endpoint (`GET /`) for server status
   - Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP codes
   - Request/response logging for debugging

### Testing Implementation

5. **Unit Tests** (`test_app.py`)
   - 12 comprehensive test cases covering all functionality
   - Tests for success cases, error conditions, and edge cases
   - Integration test for complete workflow
   - Uses pytest framework with Flask test client

### Technical Decisions

- **In-Memory Storage**: Used Python dictionary for simplicity and speed
- **JSON API**: All endpoints use JSON for request/response bodies
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 409)
- **Logging**: Both console output and structured logging
- **Flask Configuration**: Debug mode enabled for development

### Requirements Compliance

✅ **Subscribers stored in server**: Used in-memory dictionary  
✅ **Add subscriber endpoint**: POST with name/URL validation  
✅ **Delete subscriber endpoint**: DELETE by name  
✅ **List subscribers endpoint**: GET returns all subscribers  
✅ **Publish endpoint**: POST with subject, notifies all subscribers  
✅ **Backend notifications**: Print statements as specified  
✅ **Dual terminal support**: Server runs independently  
✅ **Unit tests**: Comprehensive test suite  
✅ **Documentation**: Complete README with examples  

### Architecture Benefits

- **RESTful Design**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear endpoint responsibilities
- **Testability**: Full unit test coverage with mocking
- **Maintainability**: Clean code structure and documentation
- **Scalability**: Ready for database integration if needed

### Demo Capabilities

The implementation supports all required testing scenarios:
- Add multiple subscribers with different URLs
- List all subscribers to verify storage
- Publish subjects and see console notifications
- Delete subscribers and verify removal
- Error handling for invalid requests

This implementation provides a solid foundation for understanding HTTP protocols and publish-subscribe patterns as required by the lab objectives.

# Lab 4 Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

Implemented a Python Flask HTTP server with a new backend endpoint for integer factorization, building upon the provided starter code from the Lab-04 repository.

### Key Features Added:

1. **Factorization Endpoint (`/factors`)**:
   - Accepts POST requests with an integer parameter
   - Returns prime factors in JSON format
   - Handles both prime and composite numbers correctly
   - Returns `[number]` for prime numbers
   - Returns `[1, ...prime_factors]` for composite numbers
   - Includes proper error handling for invalid inputs

2. **AI-Generated Factorization Algorithm**:
   - Implemented the trial division method as provided in the lab requirements
   - Efficiently handles factors of 2 separately
   - Checks odd numbers up to √n
   - Correctly identifies prime vs composite numbers

3. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Created unit tests covering all functionality
   - Tests direct function calls and HTTP endpoints
   - Validates correct behavior for edge cases
   - Includes error handling tests

4. **Enhanced Client Testing**:
   - Updated the client script to test the new endpoint
   - Added multiple test cases including the lab example (12 → [1, 2, 2, 3])
   - Created a demonstration script showing all functionality

### Technical Implementation:

- **Server**: Flask application with JSON responses
- **Algorithm**: Trial division for prime factorization
- **Testing**: Unittest framework with comprehensive test coverage
- **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- **Documentation**: Complete README with usage instructions

### Results Verification:

The implementation correctly handles the lab requirements:
- Input: 12 → Output: [1, 2, 2, 3] ✓
- Prime numbers return [number] ✓
- Composite numbers return [1, ...factors] ✓
- Error handling for invalid inputs ✓

All unit tests pass, and the demo script successfully demonstrates all functionality including the specific example provided in the lab requirements.
